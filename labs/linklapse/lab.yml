  LinkLapse ops suite. Exploit an OAuth account-linking flaw to bind your LinkID identity to a support seat (ATO).
  Use internal chat to deliver a reflected-XSS link to ops. Admin loads your external JS which CORS-reads /api/v3/logs
  (path leaked in client bundle) and reveals an LDAP bind where the flag was used as a password.
